_Hello Navi_

`Hello Lain! We're glad you're here! Now hold on a bit as I clean out the mess, heh.`

# Welcome to socalain.com!

Southern California's _lain_ Site

Welcome to LAin, the meetup group for Southern California Lain fans!

We have:
- A [chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#los-angeles:arcesia.net) where you can hang out with local Lains (**see below to learn how to join**)
- Meetups at local anime conventions
- Tons of peace and friendship and good times!

## How to Join Matrix

_Wait, what's Matrix?_

`It's a federative, open-source, and free protocol for secure and real-time`

_Blah, blah, blah. Why should I care?_

`Oh, excuse me. I do get carried away with my enthusiasm sometimes. `

_I can tell._

`The LAin chatroom is on Matrix! I like how you found your way here and I'd love to have you in LAin!`

_So how do I join?_

`Are you joining from a computer or a smartphone?`
### Desktop
1. Click [here to start](https://matrix.to/#/#los-angeles:arcesia.net).
2. Hit the blue "Continue".
3. Click the blue "Continue" under "Element", then "Continue in your browser".
4. Wait a moment for the app to load, then click the bottom right "Sign up". (If you have your own Matrix account, click the "Sign in" to the left of it.)
5. Do **not** click any of the five icons under "Continue with" if any of the accounts you have with them is linked to your real name! Instead, enter a username and password and email (if you might forget your password) the old-fashioned way.
6. Do the reCAPTCHA challenge.
7. Check the box next to "Terms and Conditions" and hit "Accept".
8. Under "Welcome (your username)" you'll see three boxes. Click the middle box (the one with a compass that says "Explore public rooms").
9. Type `#los-angeles:arcesia.net` into the search box. You should see a gray "Join" at the right of the search box. Click it and you're in!
