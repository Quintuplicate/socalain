## How to Join Matrix

_Wait, what's Matrix?_

`It's a federative, open-source, and free protocol for secure and real-time`

_Blah, blah, blah. Why should I care?_

`Oh, excuse me. I do get carried away with my enthusiasm sometimes. `

_I can tell._

`The LAin chatroom is on Matrix! I like how you found your way here and I'd love to have you in LAin!`

_So how do I join?_

`Are you joining from a computer or a smartphone?`
